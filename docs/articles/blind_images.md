# Blinding Images

Objective analysis of imaging data by human observers is always
important. In many cases, the file name or order within a directory will
reveal critical information about the experimental group the image
belongs to, which can be a source of bias.

To address this, you can use the two functions demonstrated in this
vignette to blind and unblind images.

## Prerequisites

1.  All files for a set of imaging data to be analyzed should be in the
    same directory.
2.  Information about experimental group assignment should not be
    detectable on the same image that is being scored. For example, if
    you are using green hearts for group assignment and scoring green
    cells in the tail, you should crop those areas into their own files
    in a preliminary step and then blind and score them separately.

## Usage

1.  Start by running bb_blind_images. You identify an analysis file.
    This should have one line per sample you want to blind and one
    column identifying the paths to the images you want to blind. In
    addition, it should have all of the other important identifying
    information you want about the sample.
2.  You identify an output directory to hold the blinded images. This
    will be created with a timestamp appended to the directory name.
3.  R will copy all of the files from their original location to the new
    directory for blinding. They will all go into the same directory for
    blinding, no matter where they come from.
4.  R will generate a new name for the file based on a hash of the
    original file location (not a hash of the file itself).  
5.  R will generate two new files and put them in the blinded directory.
    One is “scoresheet.csv” and the other is “blinding_key.csv”.  
6.  You score each of the images in whatever way makes the most sense
    (quantiative, semi-quantitative etc.) and add these values to a new
    column on the scoresheet. Do not open the blinding key.
7.  When you are done, run bb_unblind. You identify the directory with
    the scoresheet and blinding key (similar to what was provided to
    bb_blind images, but with a timestamp). You also supply the original
    analysis file and the column on this file with the paths to the
    original images you blinded.
8.  R will join the blinding key and the score sheet to generate a new
    csv file with the unblinded data.  
9.  Finally, R will rejoin the unblinded data to the analysis file and
    return that to the R session. This can be saved in a second step
    using write_csv or similar. Importantly, bb_unblind will not
    overwrite the original analysis file on its own. You can do that if
    you wish with write_csv.
