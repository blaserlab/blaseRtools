# Create a Gene Bubble/Dot Plot

This is a very data-dense plot and is the recommended way for showing
expression of single markers/genes by cell group. By default, this
function will return an unfaceted ggplot with cell groups on the X axis
and genes on the Y axis with dot size representing proportion of cells
in the cell group expressing a gene and color scale representing
per-cell expression.

But it also may be of interest to add aesthetic variables such as facets
or additional color scales. There are two ways this function will
facilitate that. First, you can supply a vector of cell groups to the
cell_grouping argument and a the cells will be grouped by the composite
value of these factors. Usually if you are doing this, you also will
want to have access to the components of this composite variable to
facet by. So you can supply "data" to the return_value argument to get a
tibble. From there you can modify as necessary and generate a ggplot
assigning aesthetics and scales as desired and using geom_point.

This function also supports visualizing citeseq data. These data should
be allocated to an alternative experiment in the cds object. To show
these data, set experiment_type to "Antibody Capture" or the name of the
alternate experiment with citeseq data. The genes parameter should be
the name assigned to the antibody derived tag. Expression threshold is
particularly useful in this case because of the background binding
observed with antibodies. The default is 0 and so by default any cell
with more than 0 counts will be considered an expressor of that marker.
This threshold is applied before scaling across markers. The best way to
set this threshold is to visualize your markers of interest and isotypes
with expression_threshold = 0 and scale_expr = FALSE. Then pick a
threshold value based on the color scale and rerun with scale_expr
either TRUE or FALSE.

## Usage

``` r
bb_genebubbles(
  obj,
  genes,
  cell_grouping,
  experiment_type = "Gene Expression",
  scale_expr = TRUE,
  expression_threshold = 0,
  gene_ordering = c("bicluster", "as_supplied"),
  group_ordering = c("bicluster", "as_supplied"),
  return_value = c("plot", "data")
)
```

## Arguments

- obj:

  A Seurat or cell_data_set object.

- genes:

  Gene or genes to plot.

- cell_grouping:

  Cell metadata column to group cells by. Supply more than one in a
  vector to generate a composite variable.

- experiment_type:

  Experiment data to plot. Usually will be either "Gene Expression" or
  "Antibody Capture", Default: 'Gene Expression'

- scale_expr:

  Whether to scale expression by gene, Default: TRUE

- expression_threshold:

  Pre-scaling expression value below which a cell is considered not to
  express a marker. This value is fed to the binary_min parameter of
  bb_aggregate, Default = 0

- gene_ordering:

  By default, genes will be ordered by a clustering algorithm. Supply
  "as_supplied" to plot the genes in the order supplied to the "genes"
  argument , Default: c("bicluster", "as_supplied")

- group_ordering:

  By default, cell groups will be ordered by a clustering algorithm.
  Supply "as_supplied" to plot the cell groups in the order supplied to
  "cell_grouping", Default: c("bicluster", "as_supplied")

- return_value:

  Whether to return a plot or data in tibble form, Default: c("plot",
  "data")

## Value

A ggplot or a tibble
