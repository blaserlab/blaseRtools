# Extract MSIGDB Gene Sets

Use this to extract gene sets from the MSIGDB. Most gene sets are known
by "STANDARD_NAME". You can filter the gene set list by supplying a
named filter list to the bb_extract_msig function. The name of each list
element should be one of the metadata column names and the list element
contents should be the values to filter for. Filtering works in an
additive way, meaning if you supply a filter list with two elements it
will extract gene sets passing filters 1 AND 2.

## Usage

``` r
bb_extract_msig(
  filter_list = NULL,
  return_form = c("id_list", "name_list", "tibble")
)
```

## Arguments

- filter_list:

  A named list to filter the MSIGDB by. Defaults to NULL which will
  return the whole MSIGDB

- return_form:

  Select from a list of gene ids or a list of gene names by gene set.
  This is a useful format for the fgsea package. Alternatively "tibble"
  can be select and all filtered gene sets will be bound into a
  long-form (tidy) tibble.

## Value

Gene set as a list or tibble.
