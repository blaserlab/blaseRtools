# Convert windows filepath to linux-compatible.

This will only work if the backslashes have already been escaped to
double backslashes. For example, readr automatically does this when
reading in windows file paths from csv files. If you are using as a
standalone function, run this in the terminal: scan(what = "character, n
= 1), paste the unmodified filepath at the blank line, and copy the
modified file path as the argument, x.

## Usage

``` r
bb_fix_file_path(x)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A character string filepath copied from Windows with escaped
  backslashes.

## Value

A linux-compatible filepath
