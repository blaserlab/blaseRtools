## Arguments

- obj:

  A Seurat or cell data set object

- var:

  The variable to map colors to. Special exceptions are "density",
  "local_n" and "log_local_n" which calculate the 2 d kernel density
  estimate or binned cell counts and maps to color scale.

- assay:

  The gene expression assay to draw reduced dimensions from. Default is
  "RNA". Does not do anything with cell_data_set objects.

- value_to_highlight:

  Option to highlight a single value

- foreground_alpha:

  Alpha value for foreground points

- legend_pos:

  Legend position

- cell_size:

  Cell point size

- alt_stroke_color:

  Alternative color for the data point stroke

- legend_title:

  Title for the legend

- plot_title:

  Main title for the plot

- palette:

  Color palette to use. "Rcolorbrewer", "Viridis" are builtin options.
  Otherwise provide manual values.

- alt_dim_x:

  Alternate/reference dimensions to plot by.

- alt_dim_y:

  Alternate/reference dimensions to plot by.

- overwrite_labels:

  Whether to overwrite the variable value labels

- group_label_size:

  Size of the overwritten labels

- alt_label_col:

  Alternate column to label cells by

- shape:

  Shape for data points

- nbin:

  Number of bins if using var %in% c("density". "local_n",
  "log_local_n")

- facet_by:

  Variable or variables to facet by.

- sample_equally:

  Whether or not you should downsample to the same number of cells in
  each plot. Default is FALSE or no.

- rasterize:

  Whether to render the graphical layer as a raster image. Default is
  FALSE.

- raster_dpi:

  If rasterize then this is the DPI used. Default = 300.

- show_trajectory_graph:

  Whether to render the principal graph for the trajectory. Requires
  that learn_graph() has been called on cds.

- trajectory_graph_color:

  The color to be used for plotting the trajectory graph.

- trajectory_graph_segment_size:

  The size of the line segments used for plotting the trajectory graph.

- label_root_node:

  Logical; whether to label the root node for the selected pseudotime
  trajectory. The function will requires that a valid pseudotime column
  be identified, usually as the value of the "var" argument in the form
  of "pseudotime_cluster_value". If you wish to use var to color the
  cells in some other way, the pseudotime_dim argument needs to be
  supplied with the correct pseudotime dimension to pick the root node
  from.

- pseudotime_dim:

  An alternative column to pick the pseudoetime root node from, if not
  supplied to var.

- label_principal_points:

  Logical indicating whether to label roots, leaves, and branch points
  with principal point names. This is useful for order_cells and
  choose_graph_segments in non-interactive mode.

- graph_label_size:

  How large to make the branch, root, and leaf labels.

- cds:

  Provided for backward compatibility with prior versions. If a value is
  supplied, a warning will be emitted and the value will be transferred
  to the obj argument, Default: NULL

- ...:

  Additional params for facetting.

- man_text_df:

  A data frame in the form of text_x = numeric_vector, text_y =
  numeric_vector, label = character_vector for manually placing text
  labels.

- minimum_segment_length:

  Minimum length of a line to draw from label to centroid.
